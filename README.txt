Jay's Portfolio Project #1 - Draft in Discord

Initial Plan:
- GOAL: Magic: the Gathering draft functionality within discord.
- Achieved via bot, without exiting the discord app
- Multiple draft pods simultaneously?
- Drafts are logged to txt files
- Set files uploaded outside of discord
- Draft settings determined by player who initiates the draft
- Draft settings include:
 - Time limit for player to make their picks
 - What set is being drafted
 - What players are drafting (draft sent via dms)
- Send image showing all cards in the draft.

Things I lack experience in:
- Python async type stuff.
 - I've worked with multithreading in C, but python's async framework I've rarely touched before. So this'll be an experience for me to learn it.
- Modern discord py
 - I've worked with previous versions but it's changed a lot.

Overall Project Goals:
- Other than just achieving the initial plan, I want to work on this every day and make a bit of progress every day. For my portfolio, this won't just be about showing off python experience, but also showing off ability to work in github and work consistency.
